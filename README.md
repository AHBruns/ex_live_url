 ExLiveUrl is just some simple Phoenix LiveView lifecycle hooks and helper functions. It helps you store the live view's current query params and path in your assigns. Additionally, it exposes ways to work with those values both synchronously (only from the root live view) and asynchronously (from anywhere).

  # Installation

  You can install ExLiveUrl like so:

  ```elixir
  defp deps do
    [
      {:ex_live_url, "~> 0.2.0"}
    ]
  end
  ```

  # Usage

  You can read about usage in the [docs](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_live_url/ExLiveUrl.html).
